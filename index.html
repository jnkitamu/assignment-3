        I have a hobby for building and modifying mechanical keyboards! This has been my most recent (<i>and most expensive</i>) obsession since early 2021 when I first came across the wonderful world of keyboards. I was sick of basic membrane keyboards that sounded horrible, then I found custom mechanical keyboards that actually sound good, which was music to my ears. <br><br> You will see below the 4 builds that I have built and modded for myself, my mom, and friend to date. <br><br> If you are ever confused with the <i>italicized</i> and <b>bolded</b> terminology used throughout the sections, please refer to this <a href="https://switchandclick.com/how-to-build-a-keyboard/" target="_blank">website</a>. It explains the anatomy of a mechanical keyboard and how to build your own custom keyboard! <br><br> Here is my <a href="mailto:jnkitamu@uwaterloo.ca">email</a> if you have any questions!

          <div class="desc">This is my first ever mechanical keyboard that I bought and modified myself. After extensive research of what kind of feel I wanted for my build, I decided on the <b>tenkeyless (TKL)</b> layout since it has the F-row, navigation and arrow keys, which is something I needed in a keyboard. I also wanted <b>linear switches</b> as they are smooth and generally more quiet than other switch types. For aesthetic purposes, I wanted a keyboard that has <b>RGB lighting</b> since it looks cool. Another must was to have a <b>hot-swappable PCB</b>, so I have the option to switch out my switches to try others easily. I bought a different set of <b>PBT keycaps</b> to let the RGB shine through. They’re also made to last longer and don’t get shiny as quickly from use overtime, unlike <b>ABS keycaps</b>. The keycap profile I went for was <b>Cherry profile</b> since it’s easy to type on.

She wanted a <b>full-sized</b> keyboard since she utilizes all the keys for her job. I decided to get <b>tactile switches</b> since it’s better for typists to ensure accuracy when typing. The keycap colour she wanted was purple since it’s her favourite. Other than that, the keycaps are very similar to my own as she had the same reasons as I for her own typing experience. </div>

          <div class="desc">My friend wanted a compact keyboard to fit on her small desk so she decided on the TKL. She wanted switches that provide some resistance when pressing, so I recommended tactile ones. She’s used to her laptop keyboard which is flat, so I suggested she get <b>XDA profile</b> keycaps as they are all the same shape on each row and have larger real estate than the Cherry. She was also interested in the hot-swappable PCB just in case she wanted to try out different switches in the future.

          <div class="desc">Right after winter term 2023 of my first year of university, I bought another keyboard as a gift to myself for surviving. I wanted to try out a different layout since I saw good reviews on the model, this one is <b>65%</b> keyboard. The main reason I wanted this board was because it has a split layout which is good for wrist ergonomics. I occasionally play games, and I found that my wrists get sore more often using the traditional layout rather than this one. Again, I decided on linear switches as I like the feel of them. The keycaps are PBT and are Cherry profile too. The keyboard has RGB lighting, a hot-swappable PCB, and a Bluetooth setting, which were just nice bonuses this time. </div>
